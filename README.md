# BEESP-MF
BEESP MF is a multi-protocol and multi-platform IoT shield developed by our pioneer EngeBOT Tecnologia, in which peripherals were inserted in addition to relay channels, also providing the user with the possibility of working directly with the xbee socket modules coupled to the shield. Modules such as Xbee (DIGI), ZIgBOT Zigbee3 (SiriNEO Technologies), WROOMBEE (EngeBOT), LORABOT (EngeBOT), SIGBOT (EngeBOT) and ESP8266-1, can operate with BEESP MF peripherals such as: light sensor, potentiometer, sensor temperature, LEDs, push buttons and relays through the configuration of their pins directly coupled to the hardware. This hardware can also be used as a shield by attaching to platforms such as Arduino, Chipkit, FRDM K64 and Raspberry PI (through protoboard cables). IoT platforms such as: BLYNK, Cayenne, Ubidots, RemoteXY, Codebender, among others, can also be easily used via WROOMBEE, ESP8266, ETHERNET SHIELD and ARDUINO with BEESP MF, demonstrating their development in a practical way. BEESP MF has been used in the automation of lamps and switches, aquariums and aquaponics systems. Our intention in this project was to bring to the market a hardware capable of integrating multiple solutions through IoT protocol modules developed by SiriNEO Technologies and others existing in the world market. It is worth mentioning that BEESP MF was natively and entirely designed to operate with the Zigbee Network operating in API mode, in this mode you will be able to assemble a network of up to 65000 devices, with digital input and output data and analog input.
